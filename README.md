# Zoo Digital

A Java Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) project developed to simulate a digital zoo. The application demonstrates core OOP concepts such as inheritance, abstraction, polymorphism, interfaces, upcasting, downcasting, static members, and command-line interaction.

---

## Project Overview

Zoo Digital is a console-based application that allows users to register and manage different animal species. Each animal belongs to a specific biological class and can perform behaviors according to its capabilities.

The project was designed as an academic exercise to practice and demonstrate advanced Object-Oriented Programming principles in Java.

---

## Features

* Register new animals
* List all registered animals
* List running animals
* List swimming animals
* List flying animals
* List predator animals
* Display total number of animals created
* Persistent in-memory animal collection during execution

---

## Object-Oriented Concepts Applied

### Abstraction

Abstract classes define common characteristics shared by all animals.

```java
Animal
Mamifero
Ave
Peixe
Reptil
```

### Inheritance

Specific animals inherit properties and behaviors from their biological groups.

Example:

```java
Gato extends Mamifero
Corvo extends Ave
Traira extends Peixe
Cobra extends Reptil
```

### Polymorphism

Animals can be manipulated through the common type:

```java
List<Animal>
```

Methods such as:

```java
emitirSom()
comer()
```

execute differently depending on the animal instance.

### Interfaces

Behavioral interfaces were implemented:

```java
Corrida
Nado
Voo
Predacao
```

Examples:

```java
Golfinho implements Nado, Predacao
Corvo implements Corrida, Voo, Predacao
Jacare implements Corrida, Nado, Predacao
```

### Upcasting

```java
Animal animal = new Gato("Milo", 3);
```

### Safe Downcasting

```java
if (animal instanceof Nado nadador) {
    nadador.nadar();
}
```

### Static Members

The Animal class maintains a static counter that tracks the total number of animals created.

```java
Animal.getContador();
```
